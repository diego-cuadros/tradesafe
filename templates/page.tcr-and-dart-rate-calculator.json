TRIR is also commonly called the OSHA incident rate, and is used interchangeably with Total Case Rate (TCR) and Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR).<\/p><p>This metric measures the total number of recordable cases per unit of work hours, giving organizations a clear understanding of the overall injury incidence. On the other hand, DART Rate focuses on the number of cases <strong>resulting in days away from work, restricted work activities, or job transfers. <\/strong><\/p><p>By tracking these metrics, companies gain <strong>a deeper understanding of the severity and impact of injuries<\/strong> on employee well-being and productivity.<\/p>"
